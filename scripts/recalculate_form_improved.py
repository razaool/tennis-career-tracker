Improved Form Index Calculation

Current form is too simple (just win rate). This improves it by considering:
1. Opponent Quality - Beating top players counts more
2. Match Importance - Tournament tier matters
3. Recency Weighting - Recent matches count more
4. Momentum - Win/loss streaks add bonus/penalty

Formula:
Form = (Base Win Rate √ó Opponent Quality √ó Tournament Weight √ó Recency Weight) + Momentum Bonus

Scale: 0-100 (with rare cases extending to 110 for exceptional hot streaks)
