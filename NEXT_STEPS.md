- 3,000+ players
- Automated data pipeline
- Complete documentation

---

## 🎯 Immediate Actions (Today)

### 1. Test Your Setup (5 minutes)

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
cd /Users/razaool/tennis-career-tracker
source venv/bin/activate

# Run complete setup
python scripts/setup_all.py

# Verify everything works
python scripts/test_setup.py
```

**Expected outcome:**
```
✅ PASS - Database Connection
✅ PASS - Tables Exist
✅ PASS - Data Loaded
✅ PASS - Sample Queries
🎉 All tests passed
```

### 2. Explore Your Data (10 minutes)

```bash
# Connect to database
psql -U postgres -d tennis_tracker

# Try these queries:
```

**Sample queries to run:**
```sql
-- See what you have
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM players;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM matches;

-- Top players by match count
SELECT p.name, COUNT(m.match_id) as matches
FROM players p
LEFT JOIN matches m ON (p.player_id = m.player1_id OR p.player_id = m.player2_id)
GROUP BY p.player_id, p.name
ORDER BY matches DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Recent Grand Slam finals
SELECT date, tournament_name, score,
       p1.name as player1, p2.name as player2, pw.name as winner
FROM matches m
JOIN players p1 ON m.player1_id = p1.player_id
JOIN players p2 ON m.player2_id = p2.player_id
JOIN players pw ON m.winner_id = pw.player_id
WHERE tournament_tier = 'Grand Slam' AND round = 'F'
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Surface distribution
SELECT surface, COUNT(*) as matches, 
       ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM matches), 2) as percentage
FROM matches
GROUP BY surface
ORDER BY matches DESC;
```

### 3. Review the Code (15 minutes)

Read through these key files to understand the architecture:
```bash
# 1. Database schema
cat database/schema.sql

# 2. Configuration
cat config.py

# 3. Database utilities
cat database/db_manager.py

# 4. Data parser (see how CSV parsing works)
cat scripts/parse_and_load_data.py
```

## 🔮 Phase 2: Rating Calculations (Next 2-3 Weeks)

### Goal
Populate the `player_ratings` table with Tennis Skill Rating (TSR) for every player after every match.

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Basic ELO Implementation (Week 1)

**Create:** `scripts/calculate_elo.py`

```python
# Pseudocode outline:
def calculate_elo_for_all_players():
    # 1. Initialize all players at 1500 ELO
    # 2. Get all matches ordered by date
    # 3. For each match:
    #    - Get current ELO for both players
    #    - Calculate expected outcomes
    #    - Update ELOs based on result
    #    - Apply tournament tier multiplier
    #    - Store in player_ratings table
    # 4. Calculate separate ELOs per surface
```

**Resources:**
- [ELO Rating System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system)
- Jeff Sackmann's ELO implementation (reference)
- Your config.py already has `INITIAL_ELO = 1500` and `BASE_K_FACTOR = 32`

**Deliverable:** Basic ELO ratings for all players

#### Task 2: Bayesian Hierarchical Model (Week 2)

**Create:** `scripts/calculate_bayesian_ratings.py`

```python
# Use PyMC (already in requirements.txt)
import pymc as pm

# Model structure:
# - Player skill ~ Normal(mu, sigma)
# - Match outcome ~ Bernoulli(logit(skill_diff))
# - Update beliefs after each match
# - Track uncertainty
```

**Resources:**
- [PyMC Documentation](https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html)
- [Bayesian ELO Tutorial](https://www.pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/case_studies/elo.html)

**Deliverable:** TSR ratings with uncertainty estimates

#### Task 3: Gaussian Process Smoothing (Week 2)

**Create:** `scripts/smooth_trajectories.py`

```python
# Use SciPy (already in requirements.txt)
from scipy.interpolate import UnivariateSpline

# For each player:
# - Get all their TSR ratings over time
# - Fit Gaussian Process or spline
# - Generate smoothed values
# - Store in tsr_smoothed column
```

**Resources:**
- [Gaussian Processes Tutorial](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/gaussian_process.html)
- SciPy interpolation docs

**Deliverable:** Smooth career trajectory curves

#### Task 4: Supporting Metrics (Week 3)

**Create:** `scripts/calculate_supporting_metrics.py`

```python
# Calculate:
# - form_index: Rolling 20-match win rate
# - big_match_rating: Performance vs top 20
# - tournament_success_score: Weighted titles
```

**Deliverable:** Complete rating system

#### Task 5: Career Stats Aggregation

**Create:** `scripts/update_career_stats.py`

```python
# Populate player_career_stats table:
# - Total wins/losses
# - Surface breakdowns
# - Peak TSR and date
# - Grand Slam titles
# - Career span
```

**Deliverable:** Quick lookup tables for API

## 🌐 Phase 3: API Development (Weeks 4-5)

### Goal
Build FastAPI backend to serve data to frontend

### Tasks

#### Task 1: API Structure

**Create:**
```
api/
├── __init__.py
├── main.py                 # FastAPI app
├── models.py               # Pydantic models
├── routes/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── players.py          # Player endpoints
│   ├── matches.py          # Match endpoints
│   ├── comparisons.py      # Comparison endpoints
│   └── rankings.py         # Rankings endpoints
└── dependencies.py         # Shared dependencies
```

#### Task 2: Core Endpoints

```python
# GET /api/players
# GET /api/players/{id}
# GET /api/players/{id}/progression?surface=all
# GET /api/players/{id}/stats
# GET /api/compare?players=djokovic,federer,nadal&surface=all
# GET /api/rankings/current
```

#### Task 3: Documentation

- Swagger UI (automatic with FastAPI)
- API usage examples
- Rate limiting

**Run:**
```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
# Visit: http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## 🎨 Phase 4: Frontend (Weeks 6-8)

### Goal
Next.js app with interactive visualizations

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Setup Next.js

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest frontend --typescript
cd frontend
npm install recharts tailwindcss
```

#### Task 2: Core Pages

```
app/
├── page.tsx                 # Home (featured comparisons)
├── players/
│   ├── page.tsx            # Player search
│   └── [id]/page.tsx       # Player detail page
├── compare/page.tsx        # Comparison tool
└── rankings/page.tsx       # Live rankings
```

#### Task 3: Key Component

**The DARKO-style career progression chart:**

```typescript
// components/CareerProgressionChart.tsx
import { LineChart, Line, XAxis, YAxis, Tooltip } from 'recharts';

// Multi-line chart:
// - X-axis: Career match number
// - Y-axis: TSR rating
// - Lines: Different players (different colors)
// - Hover: Match details tooltip
// - Filters: Surface, date range
```

#### Task 4: Deploy

```bash
# Frontend: Vercel (seamless Next.js integration)
vercel deploy

# Backend: Railway or Render
railway up
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Development Speed
1. **Start with one player** (e.g., Djokovic) for testing
2. **Use small date range** (2023-2024) while developing
3. **Profile slow queries** with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`
4. **Cache computed ratings** (Redis in Phase 3)

### Data Quality
1. **Spot check results** - Does Djokovic's peak align with 2015-2016?
2. **Compare to ATP rankings** - TSR should correlate
3. **Validate edge cases** - Early career, post-injury
4. **Check surface ratings** - Nadal should dominate clay

### Debugging
1. **Enable SQL logging** in db_manager.py (set `echo=True`)
2. **Use print statements** in rating calculations
3. **Plot ratings as you go** (matplotlib for quick checks)
4. **Keep test data small** until algorithm works
