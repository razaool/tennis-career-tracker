# Impact of Duplicate Names and Rating Entries on Calculated Ratings

## Critical Findings

### ðŸš¨ **Major Data Integrity Issues Identified:**

#### 1. **Duplicate Rating Entries (MORE SERIOUS)**
- **459 dates** with duplicate rating entries for the same player
- **1,287 total duplicate entries** (2.8x more entries than should exist)
- **Up to 7 duplicate entries** for the same player on the same date
- **Rating variations** up to 60 Glicko-2 points and 95 ELO points for the same player on the same date

#### 2. **Duplicate Player Names (LESS SERIOUS)**
- **702 players** with single-letter first names
- **21 confirmed potential duplicates** (same person, different name formats)

## Impact on Rankings

### **Current Rankings Are Severely Inflated:**

#### **Carlos Alcaraz Example:**
- **Correct rank**: 1st
- **With duplicates**: Ranks 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th
- **Impact**: Takes up 5 positions in top 5, pushing other players down

#### **Roger Federer Example:**
- **Correct rank**: 4th  
- **With duplicates**: Ranks 8th through 12th
- **Impact**: Takes up 5 positions, artificially lowering his ranking

#### **Pete Sampras Example:**
- **Correct rank**: 17th
- **With duplicates**: Ranks 28th through 50th  
- **Impact**: Takes up 7 positions, severely distorting rankings

### **Ranking Distortion Summary:**
| Player | Correct Rank | Duplicate Count | Rank Spread | Impact |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| Carlos Alcaraz | 1 | 5 | 4 positions | Takes up top 5 spots |
| Roger Federer | 4 | 5 | 4 positions | Takes up ranks 8-12 |
| Pete Sampras | 17 | 7 | 22 positions | Takes up ranks 28-50 |
| Alex De Minaur | 13 | 4 | 5 positions | Takes up ranks 25-30 |

## Data Quality Statistics

### **Duplicate Rating Entries:**
- **Average duplicates per date**: 2.8 entries
- **Maximum duplicates per date**: 7 entries  
- **Average Glicko-2 rating variation**: 14.8 points
- **Maximum Glicko-2 rating variation**: 59.8 points
- **Average ELO rating variation**: 26.4 points
- **Maximum ELO rating variation**: 95.3 points

### **Single-Letter Names:**
- **Total single-letter names**: 702 players
- **High-priority duplicates**: 21 confirmed cases
- **Ready to merge**: 19 cases (one version has ratings, other is empty)
- **Manual review needed**: 1 case (both have ratings)

## Impact on Rating Calculations

### **1. Rankings Are Inflated**
- Players with duplicate entries appear multiple times in rankings
- This pushes other players down artificially
- Makes it appear there are more high-rated players than actually exist

### **2. Rating Averages Are Skewed**
- When using AVG() functions, duplicate entries create incorrect averages
- Some players have 2-7 different ratings for the same date
- This creates artificial rating variations

### **3. Match Predictions Are Affected**
- If the system uses the "latest" rating, it might pick a random duplicate
- This creates inconsistent predictions
- Rating changes between matches become unpredictable

### **4. Historical Analysis Is Compromised**
- Career progression graphs show artificial spikes/valleys
- Tournament performance analysis is skewed
- Player development tracking is unreliable

## Recommended Fixes (Priority Order)

### **ðŸ”¥ HIGH PRIORITY - Fix Duplicate Rating Entries:**

1. **Identify the root cause** of duplicate rating entries
   - Check data import scripts
   - Look for multiple tournament data sources
   - Verify match processing logic

2. **Clean up duplicate entries**
   ```sql
   -- Keep only the most recent rating entry per player per date
   DELETE FROM player_ratings 
   WHERE rating_id NOT IN (
       SELECT DISTINCT ON (player_id, date) rating_id
       FROM player_ratings 
       ORDER BY player_id, date, rating_id DESC
   );
   ```

3. **Add database constraints** to prevent future duplicates
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE player_ratings 
   ADD CONSTRAINT unique_player_date_rating 
   UNIQUE (player_id, date);
   ```

### **ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY - Fix Duplicate Player Names:**

1. **Merge confirmed duplicates** using the established pattern
2. **Delete empty abbreviated names** 
3. **Rename abbreviated names with ratings**

### **ðŸŸ¢ LOW PRIORITY - Prevention:**

1. **Add data validation** during imports
2. **Implement fuzzy matching** for new player names
3. **Create monitoring** for duplicate detection

## Expected Impact After Fixes

### **Rankings Will Become Accurate:**
- Each player will appear only once in rankings
- True ranking positions will be revealed
- Rating distributions will be realistic

### **Performance Improvements:**
- Faster ranking queries (fewer duplicate entries)
- More accurate match predictions
- Reliable historical analysis

### **Data Integrity:**
- Consistent rating calculations
- Predictable rating changes
- Reliable player comparisons

## Conclusion

The duplicate rating entries are causing **severe distortions** in your ranking system. Players like Carlos Alcaraz, Roger Federer, and Pete Sampras are taking up multiple ranking positions, making the system unreliable for:

- **Current rankings display**
- **Match predictions** 
- **Historical analysis**
- **Player comparisons**

**Immediate action is required** to clean up the duplicate rating entries before the system can provide accurate results.
