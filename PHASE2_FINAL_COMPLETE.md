- **Records:** 3,605,976
- **What:** Independent Glicko-2 system with RD decay and volatility
- **Example:** Djokovic Glicko-2: 3167.8 ± 67.5

### 4. Supporting Metrics ✅
- **Time:** 11.5 minutes
- **Records:** 3,605,976
- **Metrics:**
  - Form Index: 20-match rolling win rate (100% coverage)
  - Big Match Rating: Performance vs elite opponents (3.1% - elite matches only)
  - Tournament Success: Weighted achievement score (100% coverage)

### 5. Data Exports ✅
- **44 CSV files** organized in 4 folders
- All rating systems exported
- Individual player files
- Rankings and comparisons

## 🎯 Three Rating Systems Comparison

| System | Peak Djokovic | Uncertainty | Best For |
|--------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| **ELO** | 3419.3 | N/A | Traditional analysis |
| **TSR** | 3419.3 | ± 123.0 | Visualization, confidence intervals |
| **Glicko-2** | 3167.8 | ± 67.5 | Inactivity modeling, academic |

All three are valid and available in the database!
