## 🚀 WHAT'S NEXT: PHASE 3 - API DEVELOPMENT

### Goal
Build RESTful API to serve ELO data to frontend applications

### Estimated Time
1-2 weeks

### Core Endpoints to Build

#### 1. Player Endpoints
- `GET /api/players` - List all players (with pagination)
- `GET /api/players/{player_name}` - Player overview
- `GET /api/players/{player_name}/progression` - Career ELO progression
- `GET /api/players/{player_name}/surfaces` - Surface-specific performance

#### 2. Rankings Endpoints
- `GET /api/rankings/current` - Current top-ranked players by ELO
- `GET /api/rankings/peak` - All-time peak ELO rankings
- `GET /api/rankings/surface/{surface}` - Rankings for specific surface

#### 3. Comparison Endpoints
- `GET /api/compare` - Compare multiple players
- `GET /api/compare/head-to-head` - Head-to-head comparison

#### 4. Statistics Endpoints
- `GET /api/stats/all-time-leaders` - Career leaders
- `GET /api/stats/year/{year}` - Year-end statistics

#### 5. Utility Endpoints
- `GET /api/health` - Health check
- `GET /api/search` - Search players by name

## 💡 PRO TIPS FOR API DEVELOPMENT

1. **Start Small**
   - Get ONE endpoint working first (e.g., `/api/players/novak_djokovic`)
   - Test it thoroughly
   - Then expand to other endpoints

2. **Use the Database You Have**
   - All the data is already in PostgreSQL
   - Just write SQL queries in the endpoint handlers
   - Use the existing `DatabaseManager` from Phase 1

3. **Test as You Go**
   - Swagger UI at `/docs` is your friend
   - Test each endpoint immediately after writing it
   - Use curl or Postman for API testing

4. **Optimize Later**
   - Get it working first
   - Add caching/optimization in Phase 3.5 if needed
   - Most queries should be fast with existing indexes

5. **Documentation Matters**
   - Write good docstrings for each endpoint
   - FastAPI auto-generates docs from docstrings
   - This will help frontend developers (you!) later
