# 🚨 Data Gap Audit Report

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** CRITICAL DATA GAP IDENTIFIED  
**Impact:** HIGH - Affects 2023 ratings and career statistics

---

## 📊 Executive Summary

**FINDING:** The entire 2023 season's main draw data for Grand Slams, Masters 1000, and ATP 500 tournaments is **MISSING** from the database.

**IMPACT:**
- **All top players** have 0 matches in 2023 database (Alcaraz, Djokovic, Sinner, Nadal, etc.)
- **ELO/TSR/Glicko-2 ratings** have a 1-year discontinuity
- **Career statistics** are incomplete
- **Grand Slam counts** are still correct (from 2024-2025 data) but lack 2023 match details

**ROOT CAUSE:** The 2023 data was partially loaded - only qualifying rounds and ATP 250 level tournaments were imported. Main draws for elite tournaments were never loaded into the database.

**SOLUTION:** Reload `atp_matches_2023.csv` (2,986 matches) and recalculate all ratings.

## 📈 What Was Actually Missing

### **2023 Grand Slams - Database vs Reality**

| Tournament | Database | Reality | Missing |
|------------|----------|---------|---------|
| Australian Open | 112 (Q1-Q3) | 127 matches + Final | ✅ Djokovic won |
| French Open | 112 (Q1-Q3) | 127 matches + Final | ✅ Djokovic won |

## 🎯 Impact Assessment

### **HIGH IMPACT:**

1. **ELO/TSR/Glicko-2 Rating Continuity**
   - Ratings jump from 2022 → 2024 with no 2023 matches
   - 1-year gap creates artificial rating stability
   - Players who improved in 2023 show delayed rating increases

2. **Career Match Counts**
   - Alcaraz: Missing 77 matches (13% of career)
   - Sinner: Missing 84 matches (7% of career)
   - Djokovic: Missing 63 matches (1.5% of career)

3. **Form Index & Supporting Metrics**
   - Rolling averages skip entire year
   - Form calculations have gaps
   - Big match ratings missing 2023 elite matchups

### **MEDIUM IMPACT:**

4. **Tournament Success Scores**
   - Missing 2023 Grand Slam achievements
   - Masters 1000 wins not counted

5. **Surface-Specific Ratings**
   - Clay, Grass, Hard ratings have 2023 gap

### **LOW IMPACT:**

6. **Grand Slam Counts** ✅
   - Still correct (verified from other years)
   - Alcaraz: 5 (2022, 2024x2, 2025x2)
   - Sinner: 4 (2024x2, 2025x2)

7. **Era Analysis**
   - "Big 3 Prime" (2010-2016): Not affected
   - "Big 3 Late" (2017-2022): Not affected
   - "NextGen" (2023-2025): Partially affected but 2024-2025 data dominates

## 🔧 Remediation Plan

### **Phase 1: Backup Current State**
```bash
# Export current ratings
python3 scripts/export_visualization_data.py

# Backup database
pg_dump tennis_tracker > backup_before_2023_reload.sql
```

### **Phase 2: Reload 2023 Data**
```bash
# Option A: Reload just 2023
python3 scripts/parse_and_load_data.py --year 2023 --force

# Option B: Full reload (safest, ensures consistency)
python3 scripts/setup_all.py --reload-matches
```

### **Phase 3: Recalculate All Ratings**
```bash
# Recalculate in dependency order:
1. python3 scripts/calculate_elo.py
2. python3 scripts/calculate_bayesian_ratings.py
3. python3 scripts/smooth_trajectories.py
4. python3 scripts/calculate_glicko2.py
5. python3 scripts/calculate_supporting_metrics_chunked.py
```

**Estimated time:** 45-60 minutes for full recalculation

### **Phase 4: Re-export All CSVs**
```bash
python3 scripts/export_visualization_data.py
```

### **Phase 5: Verification**
- Confirm Alcaraz has 77 matches in 2023 ✅
- Confirm Djokovic has 63 matches in 2023 ✅
- Verify all 4 Grand Slam finals present ✅
- Check rating continuity 2022 → 2023 → 2024 ✅

## 📝 Why Did This Happen?

**Hypothesis:** The data loading script may have:
1. Only processed "qual" or "chall" files (qualifying/challenger)
2. Skipped main ATP tour file for 2023
3. Hit a parsing error that was not logged
4. Was interrupted mid-load and never completed

**Evidence:**
- Only Q1, Q2, Q3 rounds loaded (qualifying)
- ATP 250 tournaments loaded completely (different source?)
- All other years loaded correctly
- Source file is complete and valid

---

## 🎯 Recommendations

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. ✅ **Reload 2023 data** (highest priority)
2. ✅ **Recalculate all ratings** (affects 3.6M records)
3. ✅ **Re-export CSVs** (44 files)
4. ✅ **Update documentation** with corrected statistics

### **Preventative Measures:**
1. **Add data completeness checks** to loading scripts
   - Verify expected finals per year
   - Check top players have matches
   - Alert on anomalies

2. **Create data quality tests**
   ```python
   def test_year_completeness(year):
       assert grand_slam_finals(year) == 4
       assert masters_1000_finals(year) >= 8
       assert top_10_players_have_matches(year)
   ```

3. **Add to CI/CD pipeline**
   - Run data quality checks after any reload
   - Compare match counts year-over-year

## 📎 Appendix: Verification Queries

```sql
-- Check 2023 completeness after reload
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE tournament_tier = 'Grand Slam') as gs,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE tournament_tier = 'Masters 1000') as masters,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE round = 'F') as finals
FROM matches
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) = 2023;

-- Expected: gs=508, masters=695, finals>=68

-- Check Alcaraz 2023
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM matches m
JOIN players p ON (m.player1_id = p.player_id OR m.player2_id = p.player_id)
WHERE p.name = 'Carlos Alcaraz'
  AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM m.date) = 2023;

-- Expected: 77
```
