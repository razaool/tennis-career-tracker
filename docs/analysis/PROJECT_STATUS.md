# Tennis Career Tracker - Project Status

**Last Updated:** October 14, 2025

## ✅ Completed: Phase 1 - Data Foundation

### What's Been Built

#### 1. Database Infrastructure ✅
- **PostgreSQL schema** with optimized tables and indexes
- **Four core tables:**
  - `players` - Master player data (~3K players)
  - `matches` - All match results with full context
  - `player_ratings` - For calculated metrics (ready for Phase 2)
  - `player_career_stats` - Aggregated statistics
- **Tournament tiers** lookup table with weights for Bayesian model
- **Indexes** for fast queries on date, players, surface, tournaments
- **Views** for common queries (player_overview)

#### 2. Data Ingestion Pipeline ✅
- **Tennis Abstract downloader** - Clones GitHub repos
- **CSV parser** - Handles Tennis Abstract format
- **Bulk loading** - Efficient batch inserts
- **Player metadata** - DOB, country, hand, height
- **Match statistics** - Aces, DFs, serve %, break points
- **Tournament mapping** - Automatic tier classification

#### 3. Configuration & Utilities ✅
- **Environment-based config** - `.env` for local settings
- **Database manager** - Connection pooling, context managers
- **Error handling** - Robust logging and error recovery
- **Setup automation** - One-command setup script

#### 4. Documentation ✅
- **README** - Project overview and quick start
- **SETUP_GUIDE** - Detailed step-by-step instructions
- **Code comments** - Inline documentation
- **Type hints** - For better code clarity

### Data Available

**ATP Matches (2000-2024 by default):**
- ~40,000 matches
- ~3,000 players
- All Grand Slams, Masters, ATP 500/250
- Full match scores and statistics

**Can extend to:**
- All ATP history (1968-present): ~2.5M matches
- WTA data (coming soon)

## 🚧 In Progress: Phase 2 - Rating Calculations

### Next Steps

#### 1. Basic ELO Implementation
```python
# scripts/calculate_elo.py
- Implement ELO rating system
- Calculate after each match chronologically
- Store in player_ratings table
- Surface-specific ELO (clay/grass/hard)
```

#### 2. Tournament Weighting
- Apply tournament tier multipliers
- Grand Slams: 2.0x weight
- Masters: 1.5x weight
- ATP 500/250: 1.2x/1.0x weight

#### 3. Bayesian Hierarchical Model
```python
# scripts/calculate_bayesian_ratings.py
- Model player "true skill" as latent variable
- Update with match outcomes
- Track uncertainty (sigma)
- Account for opponent strength
```

#### 4. Gaussian Process Smoothing
```python
# scripts/smooth_trajectories.py
- Fit GP to rating history
- Generate smoothed curves for visualization
- Store in tsr_smoothed column
```

#### 5. Supporting Metrics
- **Form Index** - Rolling 20-match performance
- **Big Match Rating** - Top-10 opponent performance
- **Tournament Success** - Weighted title performance

### Expected Output

After Phase 2, `player_ratings` table will contain:
- TSR rating for every player after every match
- Surface-specific ratings
- Smoothed trajectories ready for charting
- Uncertainty estimates

## 📅 Planned: Phase 3 - API Development

### FastAPI Backend

```python
# api/main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI

@app.get("/api/players/{name}/progression")
async def get_career_progression(name: str, surface: str = "all"):
    """Return player's career TSR progression"""
    pass

@app.get("/api/compare")
async def compare_players(players: List[str]):
    """Compare multiple players' careers"""
    pass

@app.get("/api/rankings/live")
async def get_live_rankings():
    """Get current ATP rankings"""
    pass
```

### Endpoints Needed

1. **Player Data**
   - `GET /api/players` - List all players
   - `GET /api/players/{id}` - Player details
   - `GET /api/players/{id}/progression` - Career trajectory
   - `GET /api/players/{id}/stats` - Career statistics

2. **Comparisons**
   - `GET /api/compare?players=djokovic,federer,nadal`
   - `GET /api/compare/surface?player1=nadal&player2=federer`

3. **Live Data**
   - `GET /api/rankings/live` - Current ATP rankings
   - `GET /api/matches/live` - Live matches

4. **Aggregations**
   - `GET /api/stats/peak-ratings` - Top-rated players
   - `GET /api/stats/career-leaders` - Career leaders

## 📅 Planned: Phase 4 - Frontend

## 📊 Data Quality Notes

### What We Have
- ✅ Match results (winner/loser)
- ✅ Scores (sets/games)
- ✅ Surface, tournament, round
- ✅ Player rankings at match time
- ✅ Basic match stats (aces, DFs, serve %)

### What's Missing (for future enhancement)
- ⚠️ Point-by-point data (not in Tennis Abstract)
- ⚠️ Injury data (need manual curation)
- ⚠️ Live match data (need ATP API)
- ⚠️ Betting odds (for model validation)

## 🚀 How to Continue

### For You (User):
1. **Test the setup:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/setup_all.py --start-year 2020 --end-year 2024
   ```

2. **Verify data:**
   ```bash
   python -c "from database.db_manager import DatabaseManager; print(DatabaseManager().get_database_stats())"
   ```

3. **Review and customize:**
   - Check database schema in `database/schema.sql`
   - Adjust tournament weights in `config.py`
   - Modify year ranges in setup scripts

### For Phase 2 (Rating Calculations):
1. Implement basic ELO in `scripts/calculate_elo.py`
2. Add Bayesian model in `scripts/calculate_bayesian_ratings.py`
3. Create smoothing script in `scripts/smooth_trajectories.py`
4. Run calculations to populate `player_ratings` table

## 📝 Notes

- **Database size:** ~2-3 GB for full historical data
- **Processing time:** ~30 min for all historical matches
- **Rating calculations:** Estimated ~1-2 hours for all players
- **Deployment:** Railway/Render for backend, Vercel for frontend

## 🎾 Vision

The end goal is a production web app where tennis fans can:
1. **Explore** any player's career arc visually
2. **Compare** legends across eras (Federer vs Alcaraz at age 21)
3. **Discover** insights (who peaked earliest? latest? longest prime?)
4. **Track** current players in real-time
5. **Share** beautiful visualizations on social media

**We're ~20% done. Data foundation is solid. Time to build the intelligence layer**
