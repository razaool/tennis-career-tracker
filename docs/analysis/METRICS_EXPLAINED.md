**Last Updated:** October 18, 2025  
**Database Version:** Complete (1978-2025)

---

## 🎯 Overview

Your database calculates **15+ different metrics** across **3 rating systems** plus **supporting analytics**. This guide explains what each one means and how to use it.

---

## 📈 Rating Systems (3 Independent Systems)

### **1. ELO Rating System**

#### **elo_rating** (Overall ELO)
- **Range:** 1500 (beginner) to 3700+ (all-time great)
- **What it measures:** Player skill level based on match results
- **Starting value:** 1500 for all players
- **How it changes:** Winning increases it, losing decreases it
- **Tournament tier matters:** Grand Slam wins = bigger ELO gains than ATP 250

**Example:**
```
Carlos Alcaraz starts at: 1500
After US Open 2022 win: 3,529 (peak)
Current (Oct 2025): 3,198
```

**Use for:** Simple rankings, comparing players, tracking career progression

---

#### **elo_clay, elo_grass, elo_hard** (Surface-Specific ELO)
- **What it measures:** Skill on specific surfaces
- **Why it matters:** Some players excel on certain surfaces
- **All start at 1500**

**Example - Rafael Nadal:**
```
Clay ELO:  3,500+ (highest ever - "King of Clay")
Grass ELO: 2,900  (good but not his best)
Hard ELO:  3,200  (excellent)
```

**Use for:** Understanding surface specialists, predicting match outcomes

---

### **2. TSR - Tennis Skill Rating (Bayesian)**

#### **tsr_rating** (Tennis Skill Rating)
- **Range:** Same as ELO (1500-3700+)
- **What it is:** TSR = ELO (they're identical values)
- **Why separate:** TSR includes uncertainty estimates

**Key point:** `tsr_rating` and `elo_rating` are **always the same number**

---

#### **tsr_uncertainty** (Confidence Interval)
- **Range:** ±50 (very certain) to ±200 (very uncertain)
- **What it measures:** How confident we are in the TSR rating
- **Based on:**
  1. **Match count** - More matches = lower uncertainty
  2. **Inactivity** - Long breaks = higher uncertainty
  3. **Performance volatility** - Inconsistent results = higher uncertainty

**Formula (simplified):**
```
Uncertainty = Base (350) / (1 + log(matches+1)/3) 
            + Inactivity penalty
            + Performance volatility
```

**Examples:**
```
Federer:     ±121 (very reliable - 4,643 matches, consistent)
Alcaraz:     ±148 (less reliable - only 990 matches, still young)
Young player: ±180 (uncertain - new to tour)
```

**How to interpret:**
- **±120 or less:** Very reliable rating (veterans)
- **±130-150:** Moderately reliable (young stars)
- **±150+:** Less reliable (new players, few matches)

**Use for:**
- Showing confidence intervals in charts
- Identifying which ratings are most trustworthy
- Comparing veteran consistency vs young player volatility

---

#### **tsr_smoothed** (Smoothed Career Trajectory)
- **Range:** Same as TSR (1500-3700+)
- **What it is:** Smoothed version of TSR for clean charts
- **Method:** Rolling average + spline interpolation

**Why it exists:**
- Raw ratings have **spikes** (big wins) and **dips** (upsets)
- Smoothing creates **professional-looking curves** for visualization
- Think of it as "career trajectory trend line"

**Example - Alcaraz's Wimbledon 2023:**
```
Original TSR:  3,317 (spike after winning final)
Smoothed TSR:  3,240 (smooth curve)
Difference:    -77 points (removes the spike)
```

**Use for:**
- Career trajectory charts (DARKO-style)
- Website visualizations
- Removing noise from ratings

---

### **3. Glicko-2 Rating System**

#### **glicko2_rating** (Glicko-2 Rating)
- **Range:** 1500 to 3500+ (about 200-300 lower than ELO)
- **What it measures:** Player skill with built-in uncertainty
- **Different from ELO:** Independent calculation, different math
- **Starting value:** 1500

**Why it's different:**
- Uses **different formula** than ELO
- Accounts for **rating deviation** and **volatility** in the base calculation
- Better handles **inactive periods**

**Example:**
```
Djokovic ELO:      3,419
Djokovic Glicko-2: 3,168 (~250 points lower - normal!)

Sinner ELO:        3,355
Sinner Glicko-2:   3,073 (~280 points lower)
```

**Use for:** Independent perspective, handling player breaks/injuries

---

#### **glicko2_rd** (Rating Deviation)
- **Range:** ±50 (very certain) to ±90 (uncertain)
- **What it measures:** Uncertainty in Glicko-2 rating
- **Similar to TSR uncertainty but calculated differently**

**How it changes:**
- **Decreases** with each match played
- **Increases** during inactivity periods
- **Resets** slower than TSR uncertainty

**Examples:**
```
Federer:  ±67 (reliable)
Nadal:    ±67 (reliable)
Alcaraz:  ±66 (surprisingly reliable for young player!)
```

**Why Glicko-2 RD is lower than TSR uncertainty:**
- Glicko-2 uses different math (more conservative)
- Less sensitive to match count
- Focuses more on recent activity

**Use for:** Understanding player reliability in Glicko-2 system

---

#### **glicko2_volatility** (Performance Volatility)
- **Range:** 0.05 (very consistent) to 0.15+ (volatile)
- **What it measures:** How erratic a player's performance is
- **High volatility = unpredictable results**

**Examples:**
```
Steady player:     0.055 (consistent performance)
Volatile player:   0.090 (boom or bust)
Injury-prone:      0.120+ (very unpredictable)
```

**Use for:**
- Identifying "upset-prone" players
- Understanding career consistency
- Predicting match outcome variance

---

## 🎯 Supporting Metrics

### **form_index** (Recent Form)
- **Range:** 0% to 100%
- **What it measures:** Win percentage over last 20 matches
- **Rolling window:** Updates after each match

**Calculation:**
```
form_index = (Wins in last 20 matches / 20) × 100
```

**Examples:**
```
Alcaraz 2023 avg:  85.6% (won 17/20 of recent matches)
Struggling player: 40% (won 8/20)
Peak form:         95% (won 19/20)
```

**How to interpret:**
- **80%+:** Excellent form, hot streak
- **60-80%:** Good form
- **50-60%:** Average
- **< 50%:** Poor form, slump

**Use for:**
- Identifying players on hot/cold streaks
- Predicting near-term performance
- "Form guide" for upcoming tournaments

---

### **big_match_rating** (Performance vs Elite)
- **Range:** -20 to +20
- **What it measures:** How much a player over/underperforms vs top 20 opponents
- **Zero baseline:** 0 = performs exactly as expected

**Calculation:**
```
For each match vs top 20 opponent:
  Expected result (based on ELO difference)
  vs
  Actual result
  
big_match_rating = Average over/underperformance
```

**Examples:**
```
+5.0 = Consistently beats higher-ranked players (giant killer!)
+2.0 = Slightly outperforms vs elite (rises to occasion)
 0.0 = Performs exactly as ratings predict
-2.0 = Slightly underperforms vs elite (struggles under pressure)
-5.0 = Consistently loses to lower-ranked players (chokes)
```

**Real examples from data:**
```
Alcaraz 2023:       +1.92 (outperforms vs top 20)
Jack Draper:        +7.45 (huge overperformer!)
Lorenzo Musetti:    +5.28 (plays up to competition)

Djokovic:           -0.79 (slightly negative because he's usually favorite)
Guillermo Coria:    -7.05 (underperformed vs elite)
```

**Why top players can have negative scores:**
- They're usually the higher-rated player
- Even winning as expected gives 0 points
- Any upset loss heavily penalizes the metric

**Use for:**
- Identifying "big match players" who rise to occasion
- Finding upset-prone players
- Scouting giant killers

---

### **tournament_success_score** (Tournament Achievement Index)
- **Range:** 0 to 100
- **What it measures:** Weighted tournament performance
- **Weights:** Grand Slam > Masters 1000 > ATP 500 > ATP 250

**Calculation:**
```
Points awarded:
  Grand Slam win:    50 points
  GS finalist:       35 points
  GS semifinal:      25 points
  GS quarterfinal:   15 points
  
  Masters win:       30 points
  Masters final:     20 points
  Masters SF:        12 points
  
  ATP 500 win:       15 points
  ATP 250 win:       8 points
  
  Score = (Total points / Matches) × 100
```

**Examples:**
```
Djokovic:   57.9 (many Grand Slams, deep runs)
Alcaraz:    47.6 (5 Grand Slams, still young)
ATP 250 specialist: 25.0 (many wins but lower tier)
```

**How to interpret:**
- **50+:** Elite (multiple Grand Slams, consistent deep runs)
- **40-50:** Very good (some Slams, regular semifinals)
- **30-40:** Solid (Masters wins, GS quarterfinals)
- **< 30:** Developing (mostly early round exits)

**Use for:**
- Comparing tournament achievement levels
- Identifying big tournament performers
- Separating ATP 250 specialists from Grand Slam contenders

## 🔍 Common Questions

### **Q: Why is Glicko-2 lower than ELO?**
A: Different mathematical scale. Glicko-2 uses a different formula and is typically 200-300 points lower. This is normal and expected.

### **Q: Why does Djokovic have negative big match rating?**
A: He's usually the favorite! The metric measures over/underperformance. When you're always expected to win, even winning gives 0 points. Any upset loss is heavily penalized.

### **Q: What's the difference between TSR and ELO?**
A: The rating values are identical. TSR adds uncertainty estimates and smoothing. Think of TSR as "ELO Plus".

### **Q: Which uncertainty is better - TSR or Glicko-2 RD?**
A: Different purposes:
- **TSR uncertainty** is more sensitive to experience (better shows veteran reliability)
- **Glicko-2 RD** is more sensitive to inactivity (better handles breaks/injuries)

### **Q: Why does Alcaraz have higher uncertainty than the Big 3?**
A: Fewer career matches (1,584 vs 4,000+). With more matches, his uncertainty will decrease.

### **Q: Is 85% form index good?**
A: Excellent! 85% = winning 17 of last 20 matches. That's championship-level form.

### **Q: Can form index be higher than 100%?**
A: No, maximum is 100% (winning all 20 recent matches).

## 📊 Metric Relationships

### **Correlated Metrics:**
- `elo_rating` and `tsr_rating` → **100% correlated** (same values)
- `form_index` and recent `elo_rating` → **Highly correlated** (recent wins boost both)
- `tournament_success_score` and `peak_elo` → **Correlated** (better players win more)

### **Independent Metrics:**
- `big_match_rating` → **Independent** (can have low ELO but high big match performance)
- `glicko2_volatility` → **Independent** (measures consistency, not skill)
- Surface-specific ELOs → **Partially independent** (clay specialist ≠ grass specialist)

---

## 🎓 Advanced Usage

### **Predicting Match Outcomes:**
```python
# Use ELO difference
elo_diff = player1_elo - player2_elo
win_probability = 1 / (1 + 10^(-elo_diff/400))

# Adjust for:
- Surface (use surface-specific ELO)
- Form (weight by form_index)
- Big match (adjust if both in top 20)
```

### **Identifying Prime vs Decline:**
```python
# Player is in prime if:
- tsr_smoothed is near peak_tsr
- form_index > 70%
- tsr_uncertainty is decreasing

# Player is declining if:
- tsr_smoothed significantly below peak
- form_index < 60%
- many months inactive
```

### **Finding Undervalued Players:**
```python
# Look for:
- High big_match_rating (+3 or more)
- Low current ranking
- Good form_index
→ These players beat top opponents but rank low
```
